## Vision Statement
The main goal of this game is to create a fast-paced platformer that is set within the theme of someone's mind. The player will go through many different levels, thus going through many different phases of the mind. 

## Gameplay 
The game consists of the player running through obstacles in order to escape the ever encroaching void. The gameplay will be fast paced with the player making split second decisions in order to accomplish the goal. There will be obstacles which the player have to overcome with quick decision and change of plan instantly to complete their escape plan. 

### Mechanics
The player will need to mentally create a route follwing which he will try to escape the room. The player can choose whichever route to run at thier own descretion. Timing in the players actions such as jumping, climbing, and vaulting can greatly affect the players time during the gameplay. It will force him to take quick decision.  

### Scoring and/or Win / Lose Conditions
The player will lose when the void consumes the player before they can reach the end of the level. If the player can reach the end of the level within the alloted time they will win. There will be a timer present in encourage the player to not only beat the level but also try to get the fastest time. The goal is to escape the room within allocated time.

### Controls
Controls will be the simple WSAD/Arrows movement format with the spacebar being used to control jump.

### Aesthetic
The aesthetic will depend on the level being played. Asthetics can range from city, hospital, forrest, and others as the full release of the game is completed.
